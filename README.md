# PDFBot ðŸ“š

PDFBot is a self-learning project that utilizes the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) API to answer questions about uploaded PDF documents. With PDFBot, you can quickly extract information and insights from PDF files by asking questions, making it a valuable tool for research, document analysis, and more.

## How it Works

PDFBot is built using Python and leverages several libraries and technologies to achieve its functionality:

- **Streamlit**: The user interface is created using Streamlit, which provides a simple and interactive way to upload PDF files and ask questions.

- **PyPDF2**: PyPDF2 is used to extract text from the uploaded PDF files, making their content accessible for analysis.

- **Langchain**: Langchain is a library used for text processing and question-answering tasks. It handles text splitting, embeddings, and vector storage.

- **OpenAI GPT API**: The OpenAI GPT API is the heart of PDFBot, powering the question-answering capabilities. It processes the user's questions and generates meaningful responses based on the content of the uploaded PDF.
